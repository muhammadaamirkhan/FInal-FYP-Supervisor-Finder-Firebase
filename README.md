FYP-Supervisor-Finder-Firebase:-
This system facilitates seamless interaction between students, faculty, and admins for FYP (Final Year Project) supervision. Users must log in (e.g., ABC@gmail.com) or sign up to access the Student, Faculty, or Admin dashboards. Students can submit project ideas based on available supervisors, which then appear on both Faculty and Admin pages for approval (Accepted/Rejected/Revision). Faculty members can manage their profiles (add/delete) and review student submissions. Admins oversee the entire processâ€”generating analytics (teacher availability & idea status graphs), managing faculty slots, and handling account deletions. For new registrations or account removal, return to the login page and select Sign Up or Delete Account.
